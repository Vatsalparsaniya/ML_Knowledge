### What is Linear Regression?
It’s a method to predict a target variable by fitting the best linear relationship between the dependent and independent variable.

### What is the Best Fit?

It can be of any shape depending on the number of independent variables (a point on the axis, a line in two dimensions, a plane in three dimensions, or a hyperplane in higher dimensions).
**Least Square Method:**The best fit is done by making sure that the sum of all the distances between the shape and the actual observations at each point is as small as possible. The fit of the shape is “best” in the sense that no other position would produce less error given the choice of shape.

### Application in Real Life

Pick any two things that you use in your daily life and that are related.
Like, I have data of monthly spending, monthly income and the number of trips per month for the last three years. Now I need to answer the following questions:

What will be the monthly spending for next year?

Which factor(monthly income or number of trips per month) is more important in deciding the monthly spending

How monthly income and trips per month are correlated with monthly spending?

## Yes, you are right, Linear Regression will come to your rescue.
