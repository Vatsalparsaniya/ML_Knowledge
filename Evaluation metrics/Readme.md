Evaluation Metrics 


Evaluation metrics are used to measure the quality of the machine learning model.
Evaluating the machine learning algorithm is an essential part of the project.
There are different metrics for the tasks of classification, regression etc. 
Different combination of these individual evaluation metrics given below are used to test a model. 

Evaluation metrics for Classification:

1. Confusion matrix
2. Accuracy
3. Precision and Recall
4. F-score
5. AUC-ROC
6. Log loss
7. Gini Coefficient

Evaluation metrics for Regression:

1. Mean Absolute Error
2. Mean Square Error
3. Root Mean Square Error
4. Root Mean Square Log Error
5. R2 and Adjusted R2
